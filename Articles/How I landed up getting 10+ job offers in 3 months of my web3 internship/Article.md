Between the years 2017 and 2020, the demand for Blockchain rose by nearly **2000 percent** and became one of the most highly-valued skills to have in the industry. 

By 2024, the net worth of the Blockchain market is expected to be around **$20 billion**. 

According to the data collected from LinkedIn, Blockchain occupies the top spot in the list of skills that have high demand. 

The high ranking of Blockchain jobs is a clear indication of how much it has penetrated the world of business. It is the most in-demand skill currently in Australia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, beating other popular technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Computing. 

Considering all these facts, I have listed a few steps to follow that will help you get 10+ job offers in a period of just 3 months (give and take).



## 1. Learn and Explore the Blockchain Tech

I am assuming that you’re an absolute beginner to Blockchain technology. Therefore, my very first step includes learning about the Blockchain tech stack and acknowledging the various job opportunities.

You would probably wonder what all jobs and careers are available in the Blockchain domain. On that account, I have listed some of the job opportunities in this domain: 


* **Core Blockchain Developer:** Core Blockchain Developers supervise and design the architecture of the Blockchain and create the consensus protocol. They are also responsible for ensuring the security of the Blockchain system.

* **Blockchain Application Developer:** They create software applications that are based on blockchain capability and architecture. These applications are also known as DApps or decentralized applications.

* **Blockchain Project Manager:** Blockchain Project Managers are responsible for the creation and deployment of Blockchain projects in a company They require strong leadership skills as they are at the forefront of Blockchain project development.

* **Blockchain Quality Engineer:** Blockchain quality engineer is responsible for creating quality assurance (QA) protocols and automated test standards while also writing test automation strategies.
_and many more_

Feel free to do some research about it and choose the best-suited role for you!

For this article, I am mainly focusing on the **Blockchain Developer** and its job opportunities**.**


## 2. Follow a Roadmap 📍

Next up, we will create a roadmap. 

Once you have decided on the best job role for yourselves, start making a roadmap that consists of small checkpoints.

![roadmap](https://gftunion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Road-PNG-HD2.png)

A roadmap will allow you to have a strategic and practical plan for your learning.

*Learning anything without a proper roadmap can be a total disaster and a waste of time; hence we recommend you to have a proper roadmap for the next 1 month.*

Make sure you create a roadmap for a small duration; and do not create any hypothetical one-year goal. 

Divide the goal into smaller and easier tasks and keep a regular track of it.

If you’re new to Blockchain and don’t know where to start, don’t worry; I have already published an article providing the Roadmap to Blockchain for you. You can check out the article 👉 *[here](https://medium.com/uv-labs/how-can-you-become-a-blockchain-developer-in-2022-c3fe3f23eff6)* 

Customize the above roadmap according to your preference and schedule.

Also, I have added a list of content creators and platforms that will help you learn Blockchain in a much faster and smarter way.

- [Patrick Collins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickalphac/)
- [Austin Griffin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_HI2i2peo1A-STdG22GFsA)
- [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/)
- [Learnweb3](https://www.learnweb3.io/)

*and many more*

Following the right content and tech stack is a very crucial part of learning. Therefore I highly recommend you to follow these creators/platforms to get a better grip.

## 3. Share your day-to-day activity

One of the major reasons why people find it tough to get a decent job is that they never share their work or achievements with the world.

They keep themselves occupied by working on multiple tasks and learnings but forget to appreciate these small achievements.

Make sure you mark it as the first rule of learning. Whatever you’re doing or learning; scream it out in front of the world. 

Share every small detail and do not hesitate to appreciate yourself from time to time.

To make this easier for you, I have listed some ways which you can use to share your learning: 

- Write technical posts on multiple platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn.
- Create blog posts and publish them on blogging websites like Medium, Hashnode, etc
- Create a Youtube video summarizing everything you’ve learned throughout the week
- Take an online Q/A session with your friends or community

*and many more*

And not to forget, I will more than happy to **collaborate with you** and **guide you** to publishing your learning and putting your name out there.

We have recently restructured the manner in which we will be collaborating on the articles (*yes, we do collaborative articles with guests too*).  

You are more than welcome to fork our repo ([https://github.com/UV-Labs/Tutorials](https://github.com/UV-Labs/Tutorials)) in which we have created the **Articles folder** - which is where we will be moving our articles.  

This article itself is one of them. You are welcome to submit a PR with your work. We will work with you to polish it and publish it.

The idea is to showcase the world that we are working and doing a decent job in researching and then submitting our work. This will create a Git History which is what I think is a great value add. 

Feel free to reach out to us if you have any queries regarding the submission of PR.  Guess what, if my team likes what you are doing, we will consider to take you on-board too with us on UV Labs.


## 4. Create a STRONG network

> *Your network is your net worth — Porter Gale*


![Untitled](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTctsCZ_x-BYHp8ZGyopakGo1JKfi78Egdx23VsUE09G2DP2hwSVB5dyDLP_sIR2PR2zAs&usqp=CAU)

Your network is where you get ideas for your next venture.

Having a strong network can help you get a decent job in the blockchain domain quite easily, I would say.

People tend to think in terms of having a wide network. They want to be connected to as many people as they possibly can.

The problem with this approach is that you can be so focused on connecting with so many people that you stretch yourself too thin.

The best way to have a strong network is by staying in touch with people who are currently working in your dream company. 

Following this way, you’ll get to know what improvements you need to work on. 

Having a strong network also helps you grow your communication skills as well as technical skills.

One of the major reasons for not getting a decent job can be your poor social networking skills. 

Thus, I highly recommend you connect with people. 

So, what sorts of things should you talk about when you’re reaching out to your network?

Here are a few ideas:

- What major goals have you set for yourself, and how will you go about pursuing those goals?
- What new products or services have you launched, and how do you see these products or services adding value to your customers?
- What recent changes have you seen in your industry?

Try it and experience for yourself just what a difference it makes when you’re staying in touch with your network.

## 5. Collaborate in a workspace

Collaboration involves a group of people sharing their ideas and skills in order to achieve a common goal.
Working collaboratively, instead of individually, helps improve productivity and gives employees a sense of purpose in the organization.

Collaboration facilitates the exchange of ideas and thoughts among team members who then weigh in on them with collective expertise. 

Collaboration can be done in multiple ways. 

For like, participating in Hackathons, joining technical communities, and building projects together.

Collaboration helps you to learn and build as a team and learn from each other. 

I just recently did one collaborative article on the Ethereum Merge with [Michael Bivens](https://twitter.com/MSBivens_), where we exchanged ideas and knowledge and ended up creating a brilliant article on Eth2.0. 

Feel free to check out that article 👉 *[here](https://medium.com/uv-labs/eth2-0-what-and-why-should-i-know-as-a-developer-36c8bcd368dd)*

## 6. Having an up-to-date Resume

An excellent and well-crafted resume can show companies right away why a candidate is a good fit. 

A well-structured resume displays your most appealing skills and expertise. It is critical to make sure your resume reflects your most recent skills and experiences.

To know some tips and tricks for writing an effective resume, check out this [website](https://in.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/why-is-resume-important) and pick the perfect job for you. 

Although we have listed all these critical points which will help you get a job but do not forget that consistency and your confidence play the main role here. 

Keep on polishing your skills, technical as well as soft. 

And do not forget to appreciate yourself each time. :)
